# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# In the final version of this program,
# the predictiveModel will take the classes listed in Django/api/models.py
# but I can't import that into my code without everything breaking for some reason.
# So in the meantime, this file duplicates the functions that are in that file,
# with the only difference being that the fields like models.FloatField()
# are replaced with plausible values for that field.
