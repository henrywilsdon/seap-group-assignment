## Client

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) was used to create the intitial client. It is a tool that creates starter page and sets up the build system. Take a look at [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to understand the folder structure and how it works.

### Dev dependencies

- NPM v14 or higher

See [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for installing NPM.

### Start dev server for client

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
